# Project Notes

This folder contains **human-facing memory** for stakeholders and developers.

## Purpose

This folder is:
- Documentation for project context and decisions
- Memory for future developers
- Reference for non-technical stakeholders

## Important Note

**This folder is NOT part of agent enforcement.** Agents do not enforce rules from these files. Governance lives in root-level instruction files (AGENT_RULES.md, etc.).

## Contents

- `project-summary.md` - High-level project status and intent
- `annotations.md` - Behavioral assumptions and UX decisions
- `changelog.md` - Chronological record of changes
