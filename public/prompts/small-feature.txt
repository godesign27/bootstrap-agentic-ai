## Task: [FEATURE NAME]

**Scope**: Single component or tightly scoped UI feature.

## Constraints

1. **Composition Only**
   - Copy and combine existing components from `/components/`
   - Do NOT modify component files
   - Do NOT create new components
   - Components are closed-world: only use what exists

2. **Framework-Agnostic Rules**
   - Reference AGENT_RULES.md for composition rules
   - Reference COMPONENTS_INDEX.md for available components
   - Reference component documentation: `/components/<component>/<component>.md`
   - Do NOT duplicate governance content

3. **Accessibility Enforcement**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
   - Reference ACCESSIBILITY.md for requirements
   - Verify semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation

4. **Complexity Limits**
   - Single component or tightly scoped feature only
   - If scope exceeds single component, use medium-feature.md instead
   - Do NOT infer requirements beyond stated scope

## Required Checks

- [ ] Component usage: Only used components from `/components/`
- [ ] No component modification: Did not modify component files
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- [ ] Scope validation: Feature remains within single component scope

## Workflow

1. Identify component(s) from COMPONENTS_INDEX.md
2. Read component documentation for usage rules
3. Copy component snippet(s) from `/components/<component>/<component>.html`
4. Compose within app shell structure (`/assets/app-shell.html`)
5. Verify accessibility compliance
6. Output structured summary

## Output Format

1. Component(s) used: [list from COMPONENTS_INDEX.md]
2. File(s) created/modified: [list]
3. Accessibility verification: [brief notes]
4. Implementation summary: [concise description]
